2008/01/23  Fixed a bug in the BAO constraint where wa was being ignored

             the full set of VERBOSE output.

            Runfitter can be given a list of parameter files now.
2007/06/18  For covariance matrix case, use BLAS to do chi^2 evaluation

             etc. type covariance matricies.
2007/03/13  Pre-compute luminosity distances when doing covariance
             matrix approach, trading speed for memory requirements.

             for 3D.
2007/02/15  New covariance matrix class in double precision, has 
             tie-ins for using LAPACK, which makes inversion _much_
             faster.
            Fixed some of the test programs (i.e., make check)
2007/02/09  Make wmap3 and bao constraints support 1 and 3D values,
             updated docs.

             made the fits converters work again.
2007/02/07  Major changes:
             w_a support added
             All support for analytic marginalization over alpha/beta
              removed, since it was biasing.
             scriptM is always analytically marginalized over.
             Many organization changes.
             cosgrids is more encapsulated now.
             Errors on alpha/beta now handled properly in all cases,
              no additional cost to output them.
             Can hold more paramerters fixed in consistent fashion.
             New public interface to luminosity distances.
             Full covariance matrix support, although it hasn't been
              tested.
2006/12/11  Added WMAP 3yr shift constraint, consolidated in
             auxconstraint namespace with baryonpeak constraint.
2006/11/30  Case no longer matters in parameter file
2006/11/29  Change over to using GNU autotools for build process
2006/11/21  Fixed two bugs affecting w fits, both of which caused
             segfaults.
2006/11/14  The spline class turns out to be much slower, so removed
             it.
2006/11/13  Introduce spline and cosmos classes to store distances
             in splines.
            Doc update to point out biasing problem with fixing
             alpha, beta
            Move over to using unsigned int in many places
2006/10/16  Fixed minor output bug when parabolic peak fit fails.
2006/08/25  MWV added support for the FITS output to contourshow.pro,
             which was moved into an idl/ subdirectory.
            Fixed bug having to do with CFITSIO using fortran array
             ordering, which is irritating as hell.
2006/08/17  Use maps instead of vectors to pass around results of
             fits to cosmological and nuisance parameters.
2006/08/15  Reorganization of fit results extended to 2/3D cosmology fits.
             Fixed a bug in estimate_allnuisance that was not handling
             fixed values of one of alpha/beta correctly.
2006/08/09  Beginnings of reorganization in how fitters return results.
             So far limited to 1D cosmology fits (i.e., omega_m in a
             fixed curvature, fixed w universe)
2006/08/03  Massive changes to support analytic marginalization
             over alpha and beta.
            New structure for keeping track of parameter ranges
             and the like.

             to perform.
2006/04/30  Minor change to inner loop when covariance matrix is
             present give a factor of three speedup.
2006/03/20  Added support for different power law indicies in
             baryonpeak_grid (Eisenstein used 0.98)
2006/03/13  Use variances internally for errors.  No longer ignores
             diagonal entries in COVFILE.
2006/03/02  Added support for fixed but non-zero Omega_curvature.
2006/03/01  Cov matricies now supported as long as alpha/beta are
             fixed for error propagation.
2006/02/28  Beginnings of incorporating covariance matricies.
2006/02/27  Massive directory reorg
2006/02/23  Converted some doubles to floats.
2006/01/18  Fixed bug in cosfitterexcept output routine.
2006/01/20  twopi is now actually set to 2*Pi instead of Pi.  
            Thanks to MWV for catching this.  Note that this applies
            a constant \chisq\ offset to all models, so it doesn't
            affect the cosmological contours, just the quoted chisquare.
2006/01/25  Modifications to contourshow by MWM to handle 3D grid case,
            plus some speedups.  No longer complains about under/overflow!
2006/01/26  cosgrids now support binary file input and output.
            Tests were added to cosgridtest for this functionality.
            A non-initialization error for om,od,w,alpha fits was fixed.
             Previously they wouldn't work.
2006/01/27  Parameter file parsing broken out of fitter to paramfile.
	    Added ability to convert output to fits files if cfitsio is
             available.
